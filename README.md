# numhash0
numhash0 is a provably-secure hash function I designed in a couple of weeks.
It features:
  - small initial problem instance (8192 bytes)
  - high parallelism
  - decent speed (40MB/s when compiled using clang and when the initial problem instance is in L1)
for more info, read the paper: (TODO: INSERT PAPER HERE)
